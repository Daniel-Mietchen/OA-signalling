      "Start off by getting familiar with the attendees. Isn't clear who and how many are going to join, but we should anticipate being flexible and scoping our time to the people who are present. Very few attendees promotes a closer, informal discussion. Many attendees may promote having a larger, more formal presentation component, as well as potentially small-group discussion or hands-on components. Generally it's important for us to cater to the experience, interests, and needs of the attendees. They will be able to provide us early, invaluable feedback on our project&mdash;even if that feedback is a lack of clarity or comprehension (implying, for example, that we should focus on clarity going forward).\n",

      "Overall, we should situate our project in the narrative of improving references / citations on Wikipedia. We're all about improving the experience of editing, and supporting the various communities of Wikipedia and its sister projects to create deep, connected, and flexibly consumed resources. We have focused our project on minimal goals in order to make the case for various small improvements that may one day be expanded into more comprehensive workflows. Our presentation should include a narrative arch:\n",
