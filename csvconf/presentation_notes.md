import * from ../wikiconference_usa

also, come up with a unique way of telling the __story__ of working with Wikimedia communities

## Story

* What if it was like a "Häskell und Grepl" (Hansel and Gretel) story?
* Want a narrative arch
** Matt: How's this for one?
*** The Häskell und Grepl metaphor comes in concerning the "trail" component of the story with white stones and breadcrumbs
**** The white stones are effective, but they won't last forever (e.g. the parents discover these and lock doors)
**** Breadcrumbs can work in a desperate situation, but birds may come through and eat them up
*** 
* Maybe 4 "choose your own adventure" stories
** could ask crowd which you want to hear first?
