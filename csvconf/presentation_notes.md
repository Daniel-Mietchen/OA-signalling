# csv,conf

import * from ../wikiconference_usa

also, come up with a unique way of telling the __story__ of working with Wikimedia communities

## Story

### Draft 1

* What if it was like a "H채skell und Grepl" (Hansel and Gretel) story?
* Want a narrative arch
** Matt: How's this for one?
*** The H채skell und Grepl metaphor comes in concerning the "trail" component of the story with white stones and breadcrumbs
**** The white stones are effective, but they won't last forever (e.g. the parents discover these and lock doors)
**** Breadcrumbs can work in a desperate situation, but birds may come through and eat them up
* Maybe 4 "choose your own adventure" stories
** could ask crowd which you want to hear first?

### Draft 2

1. Preface
    1. Who is in the room? Data hackers? Programmers? Wikimedians/Wikipedians? Wiki-people?
    1. You may have heard Brian Jacobs' talk just prior to this! (as we have)
        1. Cover any important points as a result of that talk
        1. Differentiate that his talk was about the secondary locations of data currently queryable and coming out of the Wikimedia communities, while we're talking about the way the communities function themselves, where you can fit in, and the future of data that can still be shaped, as we explain by example with our project Signalling Open Access.A
    1. 
1. (5 min) Daniel introduces Wikipedia and Wikimedia communities. Special notes on Commons, Wikipedia.
    1. Personal background, experience on Wikipedia, up through Commons, OAMI, and today?
    1. The differences between the projects, and how they all wrap together?
    1. How do these communities actually _work_?
        1. WikiProjects (communities self-organizing)
        1. Reputation (important for reviews, long-term possibilities)
        1. Protocol, process, procedures (a lot to follow, but can be really valuable/important for success)
    1. How can data-hackers identify the paths to improve the data stored in Wikimedia projects?
1. (5 min) Max introduces Wikidata, background, state of affairs, and future (includes you!).
1. (5 min) Matt introduces Signalling Open Access project as example to inspire others to engage Wikimedia communities.
    1. Problem: The cultural norm of the academic world is to make knowledge (and sources) scarce.
        1. Solution: Open Access, revolution of scholarly publishing and work.
    1. Return to H채skell und Grepl
        1. There you are, you're in the forest because your parents can't afford knowledge anymore and they are trying to leave you to starve for knowledge because in society, knowledge is made scarce!
        1. You wander upon a house dripping, glistening with knowledge. You're so excited you just want to gobble all that knowledge up. You might be a clever magician and would like to cast a spell to duplicate the house, piece by piece and store the pieces in a more convenient, transportable format. But we know that casting such spells isn't safe, because there are gatekeepers who intentionally keep knowledge scarce ($$) along with cruel enforcers who look down upon your magic!
        1. Eventually this keeper of the house of knowledge comes out and sees that in your life, you must have eaten a little bit of knowledge. Thus you have a delicious odor, a smell that makes you seem pretty tasty to the keeper.
        1.The keeper invites you inside the house of knowledge, secretly planning to fatten you up on knowledge distributed via publishing fees, subscriptions, and expensive texts in proprietary formats. Eventually you'll be fat enough to cook, and what a fine meal you'll make!
        1. But as a magician, you're too clever to be eaten, so instead you  trick the keeper to fall into the oven and burn up into a carbon crisp. 
        1. When you emerge from the House of Knowledge, you'll realize this isn't the only house of knowledge on the planet and the only keeper fattening knowledge-seekers up using lucrative schemes to keep knowledge scarce.
        1. You find your way home, and plant an Open Access garden, where knowledge is healthy and easy to grow.
        1. From then on you travel the world writing spells to inspire others everywhere to grow their own gardens, and build community gardens, and assemble big marketplaces where we share the fruits of our knowledge labors far and wide!
    1. Our Garden (OA Signalling)
    1. Problem: Signalling Openness (esp OA) is hard!
        1. Solution: Use a series of clear signals that point to the various data extracted from the source material, made available to the end user:
            1. Copyright License (Wikipedia + Wikidata)
            1. Source text (WikiSource)
            1. Source media (Wikimedia Commons)
            1. Reference metadata (Wikidata)
    1. Problem: Managing citations is hard!
        1. Solution: Make it work, prove the concept, grow with others.
        1. Previous solutions:
            * Templates (Many wikis)
            * Categories (Many wikis)
            * Namespace (French Wikipedia)
            * WikiScholar (Closed project proposal)
            * New VisualEditor with Zotero (Open question)
    1. Opportunities:
        1. Take a pass at improving reference management.
            1. Opportunity for direct improvement of quality and the editing experience
        1. Integrate with Wikidata.
            1. Metadata has a place where it belongs and can be managed with more sensitivity and rigor.
        1. Forge deep knowledge resources
            1. full source "snapshots" with deeper linking
        1. Automate, but use human judgment.
            1. Save time and energy, increase precision and accuracy, but work within "wiki" style and accountability
    1. CLOSER: Examples of open problems / opportunities

How to include this silly little joke element into each part of the presentation?
