import * from ../wikiconference_usa

also, come up with a unique way of telling the __story__ of working with Wikimedia communities

## Story

### Draft 1

* What if it was like a "Häskell und Grepl" (Hansel and Gretel) story?
* Want a narrative arch
** Matt: How's this for one?
*** The Häskell und Grepl metaphor comes in concerning the "trail" component of the story with white stones and breadcrumbs
**** The white stones are effective, but they won't last forever (e.g. the parents discover these and lock doors)
**** Breadcrumbs can work in a desperate situation, but birds may come through and eat them up
* Maybe 4 "choose your own adventure" stories
** could ask crowd which you want to hear first?

### Draft 2

1. (5 min) Daniel introduces Wikipedia and Wikimedia communities. Special notes on Commons, Wikipedia.
1. (5 min) Max introduces WikiData, background, state of affairs, and future (includes you!).
1. (5 min) Matt introduces Signalling Open Access project as example to inspire others to engage Wikimedia communities. 

#### Häskell und Grepl
How to include this silly little joke element into each part of the presentation?
1. Daniel (Wikimedia Background) - 
1. Max (WikiData) - 
1. Matt (OA Signalling) -
